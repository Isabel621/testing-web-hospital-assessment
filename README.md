# Hospital Assessment Web – QA Testing Documentation


#  1. Project Overview

This repository contains structured manual testing documentation for the Hospital Assessment Web Application.

Since the application uses dummy data, testing was focused on:
- Frontend validation logic
- Functional behavior
- User interaction flow
- UI responsiveness
- State handling

Backend persistence testing was excluded due to the absence of real database integration.

---

# 2. Test Objective

To validate that the application:
- Properly enforces input validation
- Handles user interactions correctly
- Prevents invalid submissions
- Maintains UI consistency across devices

---

# 3. Test Scope

## In Scope
- Form validation testing
- Submission flow validation
- Negative testing
- Edge case testing
- Responsive UI testing

## Out of Scope
- Backend database persistence
- Performance stress testing
- Security penetration testing

## TC-05 – Page Refresh After Submission

**Steps:**
1. Submit valid form
2. Refresh the page

**Expected Result:**
System behavior documented persisted.

FAILED, because system use dummy data



---

## TC-06 – Responsive Layout Test

**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Switch to mobile view

**Expected Result:**
Layout adjusts properly without UI breaking.

# 6. Risk Analysis

| Risk Area | Potential Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|------------|------------------|------------|------------|
| Duplicate submission | Data inconsistency | Medium | Disable submit button after click |
| No loading state | Poor user experience | Low | Add loading indicator |


---

# 7. Requirement Traceability Matrix

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Test Case ID | Status |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------|--------|
| R-01 | Required fields must be validated | TC-02 | Completed |
| R-02 | System must reject invalid input | TC-03 | Completed |
| R-03 | User can submit valid assessment | TC-01 | Completed |
| R-04 | UI must be responsive | TC-06 | Completed |

---

# 8. Test Conclusion

The Hospital Assessment Web application functions as expected for basic form submission. However, improvements are recommended in validation enforcement, duplicate submission prevention, and UI feedback mechanisms.

Testing focused on frontend behavior due to the use of dummy data.
